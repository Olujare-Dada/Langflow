### Additional Tips:
- **Rest Days:** Take 2 rest days per week, ideally after Day 3 and Day 5.
- **Nutrition:** Ensure you are consuming enough protein (aim for 1.6-2.2 grams per kg of body weight) and overall calories to support muscle growth.
- **Hydration:** Stay hydrated throughout your workouts and throughout the day.
- **Progression:** Gradually increase weights or reps as you get stronger to continue challenging your muscles.

Feel free to adjust the exercises based on your preferences or any equipment you have available. Consistency and proper nutrition will be key to achieving your muscle-building goals!








Question:
How many calories should I eat each week based on my profile?

Response:
Based on your profile and assuming an age of 30 years, your estimated Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is approximately 2930 calories per day. Therefore, your weekly caloric needs would be about 20,512 calories.

If you want to build muscle, you may want to consider a caloric surplus, typically around 250-500 calories more per day, depending on your specific goals and how your body responds.
